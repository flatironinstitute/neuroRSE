# Flatiron CCN Software Workshop Announcement, February 2025

Due to popular demand for the [January 2025 workshop]({% link _past_announcements/2024-10-01-jan-2025-workshop.md %}), the Flatiron Center for Computational Neuroscience has added a second session of its workshop on using open source packages to analyze neural data, happening in February 2025! This workshop is intended for neuroscientists who originally applied for the January workshop and are based in NYC.

{: .notice}
Note that the schedule is slightly different from the January workshop: in addition to changing the week (see below), we are running from Tuesday to Thursday, will have lunch on all three days, as well as a concluding reception.

Over the course of this two-day workshop, we will teach you how to use [pynapple](https://pynapple.org/) and [NeMoS](https://nemos.readthedocs.io) to analyze, model, and visualize neural data.

## ðŸ“† When?

February 4 -- 6, 2025.

## ðŸ¤© Interested?

Applications have closed. Watch [our website](/) for announcements of future workshops!

## Important dates

- Applicants notified of acceptance by November 8
- Applicants must notify us of their attendance by November 18
- Workshop: February 4 to 6, 2025

## Logistics

- The workshop will take place at the Flatiron Institute Center for Computational Neuroscience in midtown Manhattan.
- We will accept approximately 30 attendees.
- Lunch will be provided.

## Workshop contents

Over the course of this workshop, attendees will learn how to use pynapple and NeMoS to explore and analyze electrophysiogical data, making use of real datasets. Users will:
- Use pynapple to represent neural data, taking advantage of the shared time axis to perform common manipulations.
- Use pynapple to characterize neural responses, e.g., compute tuning curves, cross-correlograms, power spectral densities.
- Use NeMoS to fit generalized linear models to spiking data, investigating functional connectivity and comparing among possible models.

To get a sense of the material we will cover, see our [workshop from FENS 2024]({% link _workshops/fens-2024.md %}).
