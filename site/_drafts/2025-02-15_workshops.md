Over the past two weeks, the NeuroRSE group at [CCN](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-neuroscience/) ran two software workshops training scientists how to use [pynapple](https://pynapple.org/) and [nemos](https://nemos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to analyze neuroscience data! We had a total of about 55 participants across the two workshops, ranging from undergrads to postdocs.

Thanks to all the participants for joining us and to the TAs for their help!

We'll be running similar events at the future, watch [our site](https://neurorse.flatironinstitute.org/) for announcements. The next one planned will be this fall at [SfN in San Diego](https://www.sfn.org/meetings/neuroscience-2025/)!
