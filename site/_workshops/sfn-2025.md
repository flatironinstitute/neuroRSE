# Flatiron CCN Software Workshop at SfN 2025


We are excited to see everyone at the Flatiron Center for Computational Neuroscience SfN Satellite event on using open source packages to analyze neural data in November 2025!

Over the course of this two-day workshop, we will walk you through the notebooks that will be included on this site in order to demonstrate how to use pynapple and NeMoS to analyze and visualize your data.

This website will contain links to the presentations for the workshop, as well as to other useful information. Check back soon! In the meantime, see our main page for previous workshop schedules and materials.
