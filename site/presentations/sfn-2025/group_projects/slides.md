#note: welcome everyone to the CCN software workshop! we're excited to have you here. I'm Billy Broderick, one of the members of the neuroRSE team. Before we get started, I'm going to have the speakers and TAs introduce themselves. then we'll go around and have everyone introduce themselves. I'll finish up by giving an overview of our schedule, and then we'll get started!

but before all that --- couple quick notes:

- we're planning on taking some photos at this workshop, which we'll post on twitter or our websites. if you don't want your photo included there, just let one of us know
- has everyone run setup.py? did they see my slack message yesterday about `pip install -e .`?

## Group project structure

- You will work in pairs (will send over slack).
- Each pair will form a pod with 1 or 2 other pairs and an instructor / TA.
- Each pair will work through the group project notebook, found in `notebooks/group_projects/`.
- Each person in a pair should spend time typing: either alternate who's driving or each type into your own copy.
- If you get stuck, as the other pairs in your pod and / or instructor / TA.
- This is cooperative and everyone has something to contribute.
- Think out loud and consult with each other.
- You might not get through the whole notebook --- that's okay! You will still learn how to use these packages to analyze real neuroscience.
- When there's 15 minutes left, we'll regroup and share.

#note: no quarterbacking -- if one person is making all the decisions you're doing it wrong

## Figure check

#note: throughout the notebooks, you'll see little "figure check" dropdown admonitions like this. when you click on them...

#note: they'll expand like this, showing a figure. when you run the code directly above the figure check, your figure should look like this, if you've done everything correctly. if not, try to figure out what went wrong, and remember you can always ask for help
