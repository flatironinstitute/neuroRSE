## Group project structure

- You will work in pairs (will send over slack).
- Instructors and TAs circulate.
- Each pair will work through the group project notebook, found in `notebooks/group_projects/`.
- Each person in a pair should spend time typing: either alternate who's driving or each type into your own copy.
- If you get stuck, ask the other pairs around you and / or raise your hand for instructor / TA.
- This is cooperative and everyone has something to contribute.
- Think out loud and consult with each other.
- You might not get through the whole notebook --- that's okay! You will still learn how to use these packages to analyze real neuroscience.
- When there's 15 minutes left, we'll regroup and share.

#note: no quarterbacking -- if one person is making all the decisions you're doing it wrong

#note: they'll expand like this, showing a figure. when you run the code directly above the figure check, your figure should look like this, if you've done everything correctly. if not, try to figure out what went wrong, and remember you can always ask for help
