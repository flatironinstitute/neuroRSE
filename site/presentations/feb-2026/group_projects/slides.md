## Group project structure

- You will work in pairs (will send over slack).
- Each pair will form a pod with 1 or 2 other pairs and an instructor / TA.
- Each pair will work through the group project notebook, found in `notebooks/group_projects/`.
- Each person in a pair should spend time typing: either alternate who's driving or each type into your own copy.
- If you get stuck, as the other pairs in your pod and / or instructor / TA.
- This is cooperative and everyone has something to contribute.
- Think out loud and consult with each other.
- You might not get through the whole notebook --- that's okay! You will still learn how to use these packages to analyze real neuroscience.
- When there's 15 minutes left, we'll regroup and share.

#note: no quarterbacking -- if one person is making all the decisions you're doing it wrong

#note: they'll expand like this, showing a figure. when you run the code directly above the figure check, your figure should look like this, if you've done everything correctly. if not, try to figure out what went wrong, and remember you can always ask for help
