# Plenoptic at VSS 2025

<a class="button notice-light" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeZuePECnC1jj0LoLV4hHJxz6zO-SwgXX5Gn9JQXKWCRDL_mQ/viewform?usp=dialog" target=_blank>Register for the satellite event here!</a>

Come learn about [plenoptic](https://plenoptic.org/) at the [Vision Sciences Society conference](https://www.visionsciences.org/) this May!

We will be at VSS presenting about plenoptic in two different events:

- plenoptic will be part of a symposium about [model-optimized stimuli](https://www.visionsciences.org/symposia/?sym=52) on **Friday, May 16, from 1 -- 3pm** in Talk Room 2. This symposium is open to all VSS attendees, and will include presentations from a variety of researchers about how they use such stimuli in their research.
- For a more hands-on experience, there will be a [plenoptic satellite event](https://www.visionsciences.org/2025-plenoptic-satellite/) on **Monday, May 19, from 2:30 -- 5:30pm** in Snowy Egret. Participants will learn how to use plenoptic by being walked through a jupyter notebook and are expected to follow along on their laptops. The session will be interactive, with attendees encouraged to ask lots of questions. **Attendance is capped at 30 participants**, so [register now](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeZuePECnC1jj0LoLV4hHJxz6zO-SwgXX5Gn9JQXKWCRDL_mQ/viewform?usp=dialog)! To get a sense for the material that will be covered, see the plenoptic tutorial from the [Cold Spring Harbor Vision course last summer](https://workshops.plenoptic.org/workshops/CSHL-vision-course-2024/branch/main/).

Reach out to us at `neurorse [at] flatironinstitute.org` with any questions or if you would like to meet up to discuss how to use plenoptic in your research!

**Disclaimer:** Like all [satellite and social events](https://www.visionsciences.org/satellite-events/), this event is neither sponsored nor endorsed by VSS.
