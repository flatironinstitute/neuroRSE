This February, the NeuroRSE group at [CCN](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-neuroscience/) ran a software workshop training scientists how to use [pynapple](https://pynapple.org/) and [nemos](https://nemos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to analyze neuroscience data! We had just over 30 participants, ranging from postbacs to postdocs.

Thanks to all the participants for joining us! And thank you to [Ben Dichter](https://bendichter.com/) for coming out to talk about the [Neurodata Without Borders](https://www.nwb.org/) data standard, to Allison Ong and Alicja Jankowska from CCN and Marisa Dunnan from the Simons Events team for handling the organization and logistics for the event, and to all the TAs for their help!

We'll be running similar events at the future, watch [our site](https://neurorse.flatironinstitute.org/) for announcements. The next one planned will be this June before [the FENS Forum in Barcelona](https://fensforum.org/)!
