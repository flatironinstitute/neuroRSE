# Flatiron CCN Software Workshop at SfN 2025, November 2025

The Flatiron Center for Computational Neuroscience is excited to announce a workshop on using open source packages to analyze neural data in November 2025!

Over the course of this two-day workshop, we will teach you how to use [pynapple](https://pynapple.org/) and [NeMoS](https://nemos.readthedocs.io) to analyze, model, and visualize neural data.

## üìÜ When?

November 12 -- 14, 2025.

## ü§© Interested?

Applications are **now open**. Apply by filling the following [form](https://simonsfoundation.formstack.com/forms/flatiron_ccn_software_workshop_at_sfn_2025).

## ‚ùìQuestions?

Email us at `neurorse [at] flatironinstitute.org`.

## Intended audience

- This workshop is intended for grad students and postdocs who are systems neuroscientists, i.e., who analyze electrophysiology or calcium imaging data.
- In order to make best use of the limited space in the workshop, we will prioritize accepting one applicant per lab.
- Applicants are expected to have basic familiarity with python:
  - They should have used python and standard scientific python libraries (e.g., numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn).
  - They should be able to write their own functions to analyze and visualize data.
  - They are not expected to familiar with either pynapple or NeMoS.
- The workshop is open to everyone ‚Äî both SfN attendees and those interested in the workshop but not attending the conference are welcome.

## Important dates

- Applications opens June 10, 2025
- Applications due September 8, 2025
- Applicants notified of acceptance by September 15
- Applicants must notify us of their attendance by September 22
- Workshop: November 12 to 14, 2025

## Logistics

- The workshop will take place at the Omni San Diego Hotel, just a 5-minute walk from the San Diego Convention Center, where the main conference will be held.
- We will accept approximately 30 attendees.
- Travel grants will be available.
- Meals and accommodation (at the Omni San Diego Hotel) will be provided.

## Workshop contents

Over the course of this workshop, attendees will learn how to use pynapple and NeMoS to explore and analyze electrophysiological data, making use of real datasets. Users will:
- Use pynapple to represent neural data, taking advantage of the shared time axis to perform common manipulations.
- Use pynapple to characterize neural responses, e.g., compute tuning curves, cross-correlograms, power spectral densities.
- Use NeMoS to fit generalized linear models to spiking data, investigating functional connectivity and comparing among possible models.
