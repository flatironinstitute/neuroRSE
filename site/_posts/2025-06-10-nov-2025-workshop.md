# Flatiron CCN Software Workshop at SfN 2025, November 2025

The Flatiron Center for Computational Neuroscience is excited to announce a workshop on using open source packages to analyze neural data in November 2025!

Over the course of this two-day workshop, we will teach you how to use [pynapple](https://pynapple.org/) and [NeMoS](https://nemos.readthedocs.io) to analyze, model, and visualize neural data.
