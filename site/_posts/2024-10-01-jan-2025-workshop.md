# Flatiron CCN Software Workshop, January 2025

The Flatiron Center for Computational Neuroscience is excited to announce a workshop on using open source packages to analyze neural data in January 2025!

Over the course of this two-day workshop, we will teach you how to use [pynapple](https://pynapple.org/) and [NeMoS](https://nemos.readthedocs.io) to analyze, model, and visualize neural data.

In person at the Flatiron Institute, 160 5th Ave, New York, NY 10010.

## üìÜ When?

January 29 -- 31, 2025.

## ü§© Interested?

Applications have closed. Watch [our website](/) for announcements of future workshops!

## ‚ùìQuestions?

Email us at `neurorse [at] flatironinstitute.org`.

## Intended audience

- This workshop is intended for grad students and postdocs who are systems neuroscientists, i.e., who analyze electrophysiology or calcium imaging data.
- In order to make best use of the limited space in the workshop, we will prioritize accepting one applicant per lab.
- Applicants are expected to have basic familiarity with python:
  - They should have used python and standard scientific python libraries (e.g., numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn).
  - They should be able to write their own functions to analyze and visualize data.
  - They are not expected to familiar with either pynapple or NeMoS.
- This workshop is intended for folks who are located within a three-hour flight of New York City. (We will host other workshops in other locations!)

## Important dates

- Applications opens October 1
- Applications due November 1
- Applicants notified of acceptance by November 8
- Applicants must notify us of their attendance by November 11
- Workshop: January 29 to 31, 2025

## Logistics

- The workshop will take place at the Flatiron Institute Center for Computational Neuroscience in midtown Manhattan.
- We will accept approximately 30 attendees.
- For those not in the New York City area to accommodations will be provided. A limited number of travel scholarships are also available.
- Meals will be provided, including one off-site dinner.

## Workshop contents

Over the course of this workshop, attendees will learn how to use pynapple and NeMoS to explore and analyze electrophysiogical data, making use of real datasets. Users will:
- Use pynapple to represent neural data, taking advantage of the shared time axis to perform common manipulations.
- Use pynapple to characterize neural responses, e.g., compute tuning curves, cross-correlograms, power spectral densities.
- Use NeMoS to fit generalized linear models to spiking data, investigating functional connectivity and comparing among possible models.
