Eric helped maintain CaImAn, the calcium imaging analysis platform. His main goal is to build software that works well and is accessible to experimentalists. He received his PhD in neuroscience from UCSD before working as a postdoc at Duke University with Miguel Nicolelis on sensory prosthetic systems. He then worked in  computational optics with Roarke Horstmeyer and Eva Naumann, helping to develop a multi-camera microscope system. Before coming to Flatiron, Eric was a data scientist at NIH/NIEHS, working with multiple neuroscience labs to analyze calcium imaging and electrophysiology data.
