Wolf De Wulf is a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh's Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences. Wolf studies the grid cell system in the medial entorhinal cortex, hypothesising about how it allows us to keep track of our location, and looking for signatures of such computations in neurophysiological data. Originally trained as a computer scientist, Wolf very much enjoys working on open-source software for neuroscience.
